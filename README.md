This is a project to practice flexbox in css and additionally to get more comfortable in structuring the layout with html. The project was a little more extensive than the previous ones.

The result is a webpage with 4 main sections and a footer. There are several placeholders for images as well as subtexts and other texts. So far I didn't add any content to the website. It can be seen as a prototype for building the the layout in future projects.
